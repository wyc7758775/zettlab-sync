# Zettlab Sync

Zettlab Sync is a WebDAV-only Obsidian plugin for syncing a vault with Zettlab Memo.

It deliberately keeps Markdown plaintext on Memo so Zettlab can index and use the notes. It does not include cloud providers, OAuth, QR pairing, a paid tier, or end-to-end encryption.

## What it does

- WebDAV Basic or Digest authentication
- Manual sync, periodic sync, and optional sync after a note is saved
- Connection test that creates and removes a temporary remote file
- Basic conflict choices: keep newer or keep larger
- File-size and path-pattern exclusions

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run build
```

The build creates `main.js`. To test it in a disposable vault, copy `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into:

```text
<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/zettlab-sync/
```

Then enable **Zettlab Sync** in Obsidian community plugins, set the WebDAV address and credentials, click **Test**, and use **Sync now** with a disposable note first.

## Safety

- Back up a vault before first sync.
- WebDAV credentials are stored in Obsidian's local plugin data. Do not commit or share that file.
- Automatic sync only runs while Obsidian is open.

## Privacy and network use

- The plugin reads and writes files in the current Obsidian vault to synchronize them with the configured WebDAV service.
- It only contacts WebDAV addresses configured manually or supplied by Zettlab Memo during one-click setup. Managed setup accepts private-network Memo addresses and HTTPS addresses under `zettlab.com`.
- WebDAV credentials and endpoint settings are stored locally in this vault's Obsidian plugin data.
- The plugin contains no telemetry, advertising, or third-party analytics. One-click setup requires Zettlab Memo; manual WebDAV configuration remains available.
- Files are synchronized as plaintext. Use HTTPS for public endpoints and back up the vault before the first sync.
